      <title>Introducing CTransifex</title>

      <note>
        <para>CTransifex is a Joomla extension made for Joomla
        developers.</para>
      </note>

      <para>As a Joomla developer you should be no stranger to the problems
      associated with the distribution of multilingual extensions. In the past
      our users were sending translations for our extensions through mail or
      they were uploading them to our forum. It was really a tedious task to
      keep a track of the latest translations. What do you do when a language
      file needs to be updated? How do you contact the user who has given you
      the original translation?</para>

      <para>Thanks to transifex.com this is a problem of the past. If you
      haven't heard about transifex yet, you should go and check them out!
      Thanks to their online platform users are able to translate the source
      language files of your extensions into any language they speak.
      Everything is done online, you don't have to download zip files to see
      how much of a file is translated. If you update a source file, then it
      is immediately visible to your translators that there are strings that
      need to be updated.</para>

      <para>This tremendously improves the translation process - you don't
      need to exchange files with your users since everything is done from a
      central location.</para>

      <para>Last but not least - if you join a translation pool such as
      opentranslators.org - you'll have a reach to 1000s of translators
      willing to translate your extensions.</para>

      <para>Opentranslators &amp; transifex greatly improved the quality of
      the translations of our extension, but suddenly we had a new problem.
      How to distribute those translations in the most effective way? In the
      past we were creating a single installation package of our extensions
      that contained all of the available translations. Now this was fine, but
      translators are always few days behind... that meant that we had to
      distribute our extensions with non-complete language files and when a
      translation is available we had to update the whole package to add it.
      As you can imagine this is not a very effective process. Since transifex
      offers a powerful API, we decided that it was time to automate the
      process.</para>

      <para>Now instead of distributing the extensions with the currently
      available language translations we distribute them with only the source
      language (English in our case). If the user needs a French, German or
      whatever translation - he can come to our website and download a
      language pack that would contain that translation. The best part of
      those language packs is that they are automatically generated. Whenever
      a translator updates a language file on the transifex server, the
      language pack on our server will be updated as well. Once setup we don't
      have to do anything to serve those language packs to our users. The
      added benefit for our users is that they can always see how complete
      each language pack is, what was the latest update date &amp; if they
      want they can head up to transifex and translate the remaining
      strings.</para>

    <title>Installation and updates</title>

    <para>Installing CTransifex is no different than installing any other
    Joomla!™ extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions
    for installing Joomla!™ extensions on the <ulink
    url="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1476/235/">official help
    page</ulink> .Throughout this chapter we assume that you are familiar with
    these instructions and we will not duplicate them.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Getting the installation packages</title>

      <para>You can download the latest installation packages by visiting our
      site at <ulink
      url="https://compojoom.com">https://compojoom.com</ulink>. Go to
      Download -&gt; CTransifex menu item. The releases are listed in
      descending order with the newest release always on top. Click on the
      release number and then download the ZIP package.</para>

      <para>You can use the installation package to update from previous
      version as well; just install it, without uninstalling the old
      package.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Updating to the latest version</title>

      <section>
        <title>Checking for the latest version and upgrading</title>

        <para>You can easily check for the latest published version of
        CTransifex by visiting https://compojoom.com and going to
        Downloads-&gt;CTransifex.</para>

        <para>Updating CTransifex to the latest version is by no means
        different than installing the component! You do not have to uninstall
        the previous version; in fact, you are discouraged from doing so.
        Simply follow the installation instructions so as to install the
        latest CTransifex version over the existing installation. That's all!
        All your settings are preserved.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Live update</title>

        <para>There is also an alternate update path, if your server supports
        it. It is called the "Live Update" feature (thanks to Nicholas K.
        Dionysopoulos from http://akeebabackup.com) . Whenever you click on
        the Live update button in the Navigation toolbar, it will
        automatically check for the existence of an updated version and it
        will notify you. Clicking on the update button allows you to perform a
        live update without further interaction. Do note that if your server
        is protected by a firewall you'll have to enable port 80 and 443 TCP
        traffic to https://compojoom.com for this feature to work
        properly.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Setting up your transifex project</title>

      <para>Currently the only way to achieve automation is to have
      conventions that you always keep. In this section of the User guide we
      will present you with our work flow and will give you an example how to
      setup your development environment. You can of course setup your
      development environment however you see fit, but we cannot guarantee
      that the CTransifex extension will work for you in that case.</para>

      <para>First let us look at our folder structure.</para>

      <graphic fileref="images/structure.PNG"/>

      <para>As you can see from the screen shot above our project structure
      has a very specific form. First of all - all the files that have
      anything to do with the extension that we develop will land in the
      com_ctransifex folder. Then inside that folder we store the transifex
      config (in the .tx folder). Inside the build folder we have our phing
      scripts that help us create the zip package of an extension. The docs
      folder is obviously for documentation and the source folder is actually
      where we have the extensions code. As you can see from the screen shot
      the content of the source folder resembles the Joomla folder structure.
      The language files are located in:</para>

      <programlisting>administrator/language/&lt;lang&gt;/&lt;lang&gt;.com_componentname.ini
language/&lt;lang&gt;/&lt;lang&gt;.com_componentname.ini</programlisting>

      <para>&lt;lang&gt; is obviously the ISO representation of the language
      -&gt; such as en-GB , de-DE etc. Now that we are familiar with the
      project structure let us create the project on transifex.com .</para>

      <para>Go to transifex.com and login into your account. On the dashboard
      click on "Add new project".</para>

      <graphic fileref="images/transifex-dashboard.PNG"/>

      <para>You will be presented with a screen similar to the one below. Fill
      in the required information and click on "Create project".</para>

      <graphic fileref="images/create-project.PNG"/>

      <para>Once the project is saved you will be redirected to the overview
      page of that project.</para>

      <graphic fileref="images/transifex-project.PNG"/>

      <para>Now that we have created the project on transifex we need to need
      to download the transifex client (if we want to easily download/upload
      language files). To download the latest version of the transifex client
      go to this page: http://help.transifex.com/features/client/</para>

      <para>Once you've installed the transifex client you can navigate to
      your extension directory.</para>

      <note>
        <para>In our example the extension directory is com_ctransifex.</para>
      </note>

      <note>
        <para>We are developing on windows - that is why we will be directly
        calling the tx.exe in the console. If you are on Linux or mac (you
        would generally need to just type <emphasis role="bold">tx</emphasis>
        in the console)</para>
      </note>

      <para>In the console type:</para>

      <programlisting>tx.exe init</programlisting>

      <para>The init command will create the .tx folder for you and it will
      place a .config file in it. Now for Joomla development we will need to
      make modifications to the .config file. Open the .config file with your
      preferred editor and at the beginning of the file write:</para>

</programlisting>

      <para>The lang_map line maps the transifex language format to the Joomla
      one.</para>

      <para>The type line tells transifex that we are dealing with ini
      files.</para>

      <para>Now we need to define some resources:</para>

      <programlisting>[compojoom-ctransifex.admin_com_ctransifex]
file_filter = source\administrator\language\&lt;lang&gt;\&lt;lang&gt;.com_ctransifex.ini
source_file = source\administrator\language\en-GB\en-GB.com_ctransifex.ini
source_lang = en_GB</programlisting>

      <para>In the first line the "compojoom-ctransifex" is the project name
      as specified in transifex. (project URL) the "admin_com_ctransifex" is
      the resource name.</para>

      <para>file_filter defines a pattern for our language files. In this case
      -&gt; each new language file will be saved at the location defined here.
      &lt;lang&gt; will be replaced with en-GB, de-DE etc.</para>

      <para>source_file defines the language source file</para>

      <para>source_lang determines that the source file is in en_GB
      (English).</para>

      <para>As you can see from the code this is our backend (administrator)
      language file for that extension. For the frontend it will look like
      this:</para>

      <programlisting>[compojoom-ctransifex.frontend_com_ctransifex]
file_filter = source\language\&lt;lang&gt;\&lt;lang&gt;.com_ctransifex.ini
source_file = source\language\en-GB\en-GB.com_ctransifex.ini
source_lang = en_GB</programlisting>

      <para>The whole .config file looks like this:</para>

</programlisting>

      <para>You are already getting the idea! Now once you've modified the
      .config file to match your project you can go back to the console and
      push your sources to the server:</para>

      <programlisting>tx.exe push -s</programlisting>

      <para>Each resource will be pushed to transifex. If it is not existing
      it will be created. Once you are ready -&gt; you'll see that you have
      new resources in transifex and basically your project is ready to be
      translated.</para>

    <title>Using the CTransifex extension</title>

    <para>In this chapter we will go through the basics of setting up the
    CTransifex extension.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Options</title>

      <para>To access the component options you need to first login into your
      Joomla backend and then navigate to components-&gt;CTransifex. Once in
      the component click on the options button. The options are divided in 2
      tabs "Transifex" &amp; "Install.xml". In the transifex tab you can
      provide your username &amp; password for transifex.com - it is required
      for the transifex API. Without this information we would not be able to
      request information for any project and download the files from
      transifex.</para>

      <para>The lang map is used to match the transifex languages to the
      Joomla language. We provide a pretty good default mapping, but if you
      find that we've missed something just add it to this field.</para>

      <note>
        <para>We merge the content of this field with the value of lang_map in
        your .config file (if any)</para>
      </note>

      <para>Each language package needs an install.xml file in order for
      Joomla to be able to install the language on the site. We create that
      file automatically &amp; in the install.xml file you are able to set
      some of the values for this file like - author, author email, author_url
      &amp; copyright.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Creating new project</title>

      <para>To create a new project make sure that you are logged in the
      Joomla backend and then go to -&gt; components -&gt; CTransifex -&gt;
      projects. Click on the "new" button. On the new screen you will see a
      form. When you hover with the mouse over a field label you should get a
      tool tip explaining what this field is for. The fields that are maybe
      new to you are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Transifex project slug - this is the project name as defined
          in transifex. Make sure to enter the correct name here - otherwise
          we won't be able to get the details for the project from
          transifex.com</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Extension name - this is the name that we will write in the
          install.xml for each language package. This would generally be the
          name of your extension. For example com_hotspots, com_ctransifex
          etc</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Transifex config - just copy paste your .config file for that
          project in this field</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <important>
        <para>The transifex config is very important. We use it to match the
        resource names to actual file names and to determine if the resource
        is a backend language file or a frontend language file. Whenever you
        add a new resource to your project in transifex you should update this
        field with resource definition as well. Otherwise we won't be able to
        fetch the file and add it to the language pack.</para>

        <para>We determine if a file is a backend or frontend language by
        searching for the words "admin", "administrator" or "backend" in the
        file_filter for each resource. If we find that word we will place this
        file in the admin folder. If the file_filter doesn't contain any of
        those words then it will be treated as a frontend file.</para>
      </important>

      <title>Generating language packs for the first time</title>

      <para>Once you've created a new project you can try to fetch all
      available translations and create the language packs. To do this on the
      projects screen in the status column you'll see a button with 2 arrows
      -&gt; just press it and a modal window will appear. Click on "Get data"
      and let the script do its job.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Taking all resources from transifex.com is a time intensive
        task. Depending on how many resources and languages your project has
        it can take just 5 mins or 30. Don't refresh the page while the script
        is working. If the script is not responding for more than 2mins it
        means that something went wrong. You can contact us for support or try
        to debug the Ajax request and see what's going on.</para>
      </note>

      <note>
        <para>Packs are saved in /media/com_ctransifex/packages/</para>

    <section>
      <title>Webhooks</title>

      <para>Generating language packs with 1 click is cool, but what if you
      want to further automate the process? This is where the webhooks come
      into the game. Transifex will notify your site in case something changes
      with a translation (for example when it is 100% complete). To make use
      of this feature on the projects page in transifex you will see a column
      called webhooks. Copy the URL from there and paste it in your web hook
      URL in transifex.com (project's dashboard -&gt; then manage project
      -&gt; scroll down to find the field). Once you add the URL, transifex
      will always call it when something changes. Then we will generate the
      new language pack for the specific language.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Make sure that you've already generated the language files
        before starting to use this feature. (refer to "Generating language
        packs for the first time" section)</para>
